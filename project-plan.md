# TV Show Tracking Web Application

## Objective
I want to create a mobile web application to track the tv shows I'm watching and have previously watched. 

## Functionality
I should be able to search for a tv show from a publicy available database, and either add it to my watch list or "previously watched" library. 
Shows on my watch list should show what network or application they're on, and their release schedule for new episodes or if all episodes are already live.
I should be able to rate previously watched shows on a simple star rating scale from 1 to 5. 
There needs to be a simple backend that can store this data to my personal account and allow other users to sign in and create their own accounts. 

## Technical Considerations 
- We want this site to be optimized for mobile web.
- This site is going to be primarily for personal use, so we don't anticipate a large volume of traffic or large storage needs.
- We would prefer to stick to free and open source solutions for API, data storage, and web deployment even if the limits are restrictive. 
- For a log in system, let's use log in with google or log in with apple. Make sure to give me detailed instructions for how to set that up with my google or apple account. If log in with apple is not free, then let's skip it. 
- For tech stack, let's use React for the frontend, and either Express/Node or Ruby on rails for the backend, whichever is better for this use case.
