# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TV show tracking web application designed for mobile web use. The application allows users to:
- Search for TV shows from a public database
- Add shows to a watchlist or "previously watched" library
- View show details including network/platform and release schedules
- Rate previously watched shows (1-5 star scale)
- Manage personal accounts with Google/Apple login

## Project Status

This appears to be a new project with only a project plan document currently in place. No code has been written yet.

## Technical Requirements

- **Target Platform**: Mobile web optimized
- **Scale**: Personal use, low traffic volume
- **Cost Constraints**: Free and open source solutions preferred
- **Authentication**: Google login (required), Apple login (if free)
- **Backend**: Simple backend for user data storage
- **Database**: Public TV show database integration required

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the technology stack and build tools haven't been established yet. Future development will need to:

1. Choose and initialize a web framework suitable for mobile web
2. Set up authentication with Google (and potentially Apple)
3. Integrate with a TV show database API
4. Implement backend data storage solution
5. Set up deployment pipeline for the chosen hosting platform

## Key Project Constraints

- Must work well on mobile browsers
- Should use free/open source solutions where possible
- Authentication setup will require detailed Google (and possibly Apple) developer account configuration
